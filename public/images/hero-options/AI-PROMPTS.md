# AI Image Generation Prompts for Hero Background

Use these prompts with Midjourney, DALL-E, or other AI image generators.

## Base Prompt
Create a soft, calming abstract background for a children's sensory-friendly hair salon website hero section. Use an earth-toned palette of sage green (#5B8A8A), warm brown (#6B5B4F), cream (#F8F6F3), and seafoam (#D4E5E5). The style should be organic and gentle — think soft watercolor washes, subtle botanical silhouettes, or flowing organic shapes. No harsh lines or high-contrast elements. The composition should leave space on the left or center for overlaid text. Dreamy, nurturing, and grounded feeling. No people, no text, no logos. High resolution, horizontal 16:9 aspect ratio.
